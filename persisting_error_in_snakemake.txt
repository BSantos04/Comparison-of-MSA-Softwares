Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule run_analysis in file /home/ynot/comparison_of_msa_softwares/Snakefile, line 24:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
MSA_Info_{dataset|basename} (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
