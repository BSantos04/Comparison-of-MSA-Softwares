# Comparison of MSA Softwares

## Description

This project make a comparative analysis of four of the most used Multiple Sequence Alignment softwares of our choice, having in consideration RAM usage (in kB),CPU usage (in %), execution time (in seconds), SP-Score and an overall scoring function made by us.

Among the MSA softwares, we selected: MAFFT, MUSCLE, KAlign2 and ClustalOmega. 

This analysis is made with the purpose of finding out which one is the best as an overall certain circunstances (depending on the used dataset), and helps the user to find out the best software to fulfill his needs.

## Requirements
- Docker v26.1.3
- Snakemake v8.27.1

## Installation
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/lbinf_24-25/shimodaira/comparison_of_msa_softwares.git
```

## Usage
Before running the pipeline, donÂ´t forgot to give give yourself permission to use Docker.

Try this:
```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```
Now you can run the pipeline without any issues:
```
snakemake --config dataset={path/to/dataset} matrix={path/to/scoring/matrix}
```

### Example
```
snakemake --config dataset=datasets/sample.fasta matrix=scoring_matrices/BLOSUM62
```

### Check Results
```
ls MSA_Info_{basename_of_the_dataset}
```

### Expected Outputs
- Barplot containing the final RAM usage values of every software (RAM_Usage.png)

- Barplot containing the final CPU usage values of every software (CPU_Usage.png)

- Barplot containing the final SP-Score usage values of every software (SP-Scores.png)

- Barplot containing the final execution eime values of every software (Execution_Times.png)

- Barplot containing the final overall score values of every software (Overall_Scores.png)

- Log file summarizing the final results (MSA_Info_{dataset_basename}.log)
