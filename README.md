## Preparação

For everything to run smoothly, we will be working inside a docker. To acquire a docker image with the necessary programs, we will pull the last version of the image from this project's [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/stargazernex/lbproject/tags).
```
docker pull stargazernex/lbproject:<Version>
```
Remember to swap <Version> for the last version available in the DockerHub. Alternatively, you may also use the Dockerfile in this repository
